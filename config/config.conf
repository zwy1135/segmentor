# This file is usually generated from a python dictionary where I manage 
# all the parameters of the experiments and their variations.
# Providing the all experiment framework would be a bit complicated.
# The good news is that you can modify this file manually quite easily.
# Each line have the following format:
#      CATEGORY nb_of_pair key1 value1 .... keyN valueN
# All is space separated. The order of the pair in one line doesn't matter.
# Values that are vectors are comma separated eg: x,y,z
# Values that are matrices are coma/semi colon separated eg: a,b;c,d
# For this example only two category are read 'neighborhood' and 'field'
# You can provide as many as you like
# If you use a neighborhood or a field in the definition of an other field
# you should have declared it before.
